Fine tuned [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) model for all of the U.S. Presidents, allowing
users to personally "chat" with them. The intention is to use this tool as a history education platform to immerse students in the Socratic Method.

This is a React/Express/Node project with pipelines based on Python's transformers library.
