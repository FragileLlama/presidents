 ![Screenshot 2024-06-10 021650](https://github.com/FragileLlama/presidents/assets/102778572/bff6641e-1f73-4525-8aa5-562d2f05fa26)
Fine tuned [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) model for all of the U.S. Presidents, allowing
users to personally "chat" with them. The intention is to use this tool as a history education platform to immerse students in the Socratic Method.

Models were trained with data from [The White House Historical Association](https://www.whitehousehistory.org), [Britanica](https://www.britannica.com), and other sites specific to
the individual president.

This is a React/Express/Node project with pipelines based on Python's transformers library.
